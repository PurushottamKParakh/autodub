## 10. Integration Verification âœ…

### Pipeline Flow
```
1. Download âœ…
2. Extract Audio âœ…
2.5. Separate Vocals (Demucs) âœ…
3. Transcribe âœ…
3.5. Extract Speaker Samples âœ… (if voice_cloning=true)
3.6. Clone Voices âœ… (if voice_cloning=true)
4. Translate âœ…
5. Synthesize âœ… (uses cloned or stock voices)
6. Align âœ…
6.5. Mix with Background âœ…
7. Merge âœ…
```

### Conditional Logic
- [x] Voice cloning only runs if `use_voice_cloning=True`
- [x] Synthesis uses cloned voices if available
- [x] Falls back to stock voices if cloning disabled
- [x] Demucs always runs (provides clean vocals)

- [x] Logs warnings for edge cases

### Voice Cloning
- [x] Try-catch around cloning API calls
- [x] Falls back to stock voices on failure
- [x] Detailed error logging

### Synthesis
- [x] Checks if cloned_voices dict exists
- [x] Falls back to default voice if speaker not found
- [x] Continues pipeline on individual segment failures

---

- **Problem**: Line 23 missing `use_voice_cloning` parameter
- **Fix**: Added `use_voice_cloning=False` to signature
- **Status**: âœ… FIXED

### Issue 2: Double colon in function definition

- **Problem**: Line 91 missing comma after `end_time`
- **Fix**: Added comma
- **Status**: âœ… FIXED

### Issue 5: Wrong parameter order in job_manager.py
- **Problem**: `use_voice_cloning` before `end_time`
- **Fix**: Reordered parameters
- **Status**: âœ… FIXED
