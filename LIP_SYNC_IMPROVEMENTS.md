# ✅ Lip-Sync Improvements Implemented

## Changes Made

### 1. Tighter Alignment Tolerance (5% instead of 10%)

**File**: `backend/services/pipeline.py`

**Before**:
```python
if abs(speed_factor - 1.0) > 0.1:  # 10% tolerance
```

**After**:
```python
if abs(speed_factor - 1.0) > 0.05:  # 5% tolerance for better lip-sync
```

**Impact**:
- More segments will be adjusted to match original timing
- Reduces cumulative timing drift over long videos
- Better synchronization with lip movements

---

### 2. Enhanced Logging for Alignment

**Added detailed logs**:
```
[ALIGNMENT] Segment 0.00s-3.50s:
[ALIGNMENT]   Original duration: 3.50s
[ALIGNMENT]   Synthesized duration: 3.75s
[ALIGNMENT]   Speed factor: 1.07x
[ALIGNMENT] Adjusting segment speed to 1.07x
[ALIGNMENT] ✅ Speed adjusted successfully
```

**Benefits**:
- Easy to debug timing issues
- See exactly which segments are being adjusted
- Monitor alignment quality

### 3. Optimized Voice Settings for Better Control

**File**: `backend/services/synthesizer.py`

**Added to both methods**:
- `synthesize_text()` - for stock voices
- `synthesize_segments_with_cloned_voices()` - for cloned voices

**Settings Applied**:
```python
VoiceSettings(
    stability=0.5,           # Balanced stability for natural speech
    similarity_boost=0.75,   # High similarity to cloned voice
    style=0.0,               # Neutral style for consistent timing
    use_speaker_boost=True   # Enhance speaker characteristics
)
```

**What Each Setting Does**:

1. **stability=0.5** (Range: 0.0-1.0)
   - Lower = More expressive but variable timing
   - Higher = More consistent but monotone
   - 0.5 = Sweet spot for natural + consistent

2. **similarity_boost=0.75** (Range: 0.0-1.0)
   - Controls how closely it matches the cloned voice
   - 0.75 = High similarity while maintaining quality

3. **style=0.0** (Range: 0.0-1.0)
   - Controls exaggeration and style variations
   - 0.0 = Neutral, more predictable timing
   - Good for lip-sync consistency

4. **use_speaker_boost=True**
   - Enhances speaker characteristics
   - Better for cloned voices
   - Maintains voice quality

## Expected Improvements

### Before Changes:
- ❌ 10% tolerance = up to 18 seconds drift in 3-minute video
- ❌ No voice settings = unpredictable speech timing
- ❌ No detailed logs = hard to debug

### After Changes:
- ✅ 5% tolerance = max 9 seconds drift (50% improvement)
- ✅ Optimized settings = more consistent speech timing
- ✅ Detailed logs = easy to identify problem segments

---

## How It Works Now

### Synthesis Phase:
1. Generate speech with optimized voice settings
2. Settings ensure more consistent timing
3. Less variation = easier to align

### Alignment Phase:
1. Compare synthesized vs original duration
2. If difference > 5% (was 10%):
   - Adjust speed using ffmpeg atempo filter
   - Preserve pitch quality
3. Log all timing information
4. Concatenate aligned segments

### Result:
- Dubbed audio matches original timing more closely
- Better lip-sync throughout the video
- Maintains natural voice quality

---

## Testing Recommendations

### Test Scenarios:

1. **Short Video (30 seconds)**
   - Should have near-perfect lip-sync
   - Minimal speed adjustments needed

2. **Medium Video (2-3 minutes)**
   - Good lip-sync throughout
   - Some segments may need adjustment
   - Check logs for timing info

3. **Long Video (5+ minutes)**
   - Better than before but may still drift slightly
   - More segments will be adjusted
   - Monitor cumulative timing

### What to Look For:

✅ **Good Signs**:
- Lips match speech closely
- No noticeable drift
- Natural-sounding audio
- Logs show < 10% speed adjustments

⚠️ **Warning Signs**:
- Lips drift over time
- Audio sounds sped up/slowed down
- Logs show > 20% speed adjustments
- Many segments need adjustment

## Further Improvements (Future)

If lip-sync is still not perfect, consider:

### Option 3: Word-Level Alignment
- Use Deepgram's word timestamps
- Align each word individually
- More precise but more complex

### Option 4: Iterative Synthesis
- Generate speech multiple times
- Pick the one closest to target duration
- Higher API costs but better results

### Option 5: Custom TTS Model
- Train model on timing constraints
- Generate speech with exact duration
- Most accurate but requires ML expertise

---

## Configuration

Current settings are optimized for:
- Multi-speaker videos
- Cloned voices
- Natural-sounding speech
- Good lip-sync balance

To adjust for different priorities:

**More Natural Speech** (less strict timing):
```python
stability=0.4
style=0.2
tolerance=0.08
```

**Stricter Timing** (may sound less natural):
```python
stability=0.6
style=0.0
tolerance=0.03
```

## Status

**✅ IMPLEMENTED AND READY**

All changes are:
- Syntax verified
- Backward compatible
- Auto-reload ready (debug mode)

**Next Steps**:
1. Test with a video
2. Check logs for alignment details
3. Verify lip-sync quality
4. Adjust settings if needed
