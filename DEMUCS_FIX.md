# ✅ Demucs Audio Backend Issue - FIXED

## Problem
```
RuntimeError: Couldn't find appropriate backend to handle uri 
temp/separated/htdemucs/.../vocals.wav and format None.
```

## Root Cause
- Python 3.13 + torchaudio requires an audio backend to save WAV files
- `soundfile` library was missing from dependencies
- Demucs uses torchaudio internally to save separated audio files

## Solution Applied

### 1. Installed soundfile
```bash
pip install soundfile
```

### 2. Updated requirements.txt
Added: `soundfile>=0.12.1`

### 3. Verification
```
✅ torchaudio backend available: ['soundfile']
```

## Complete Requirements
